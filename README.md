# Image-filters 🏙️🏙️
Script to apply some filters to BMP images. Written entirely in c ++.

## Run it
Just clone the project using <code> git clone </code> in the directory where you want to use the project. Once the project is cloned, the most important files you will have will be the "makefile" file and the code itself. In addition, certain sample images are also provided in an additional folder.

To run it you must have an input directory (the one we give as an example is valid) and an output directory (it can be the same as the input directory). Once this is cleared, simply type <code>make</code> in the terminal, in the root directory of the project. If there are no errors, continue entering the following command:
  > ./img-par filter input_directory output_directory
